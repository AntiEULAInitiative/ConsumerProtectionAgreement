Press Release â€“ The Anti-EULA Initiative
ðŸ“¢ For Immediate Release

Consumers Strike Back: Introducing the Anti-EULA Initiative
The era of unfair End User License Agreements (EULAs) is over. For too long, corporations have buried exploitative terms in fine print, stripping users of 
privacy, refund rights, and legal protections. But now, a grassroots movement is flipping the scriptâ€”the Anti-EULA Initiative, an open-source framework 
designed to force companies to respect consumer demands before engaging with their products.

"If we all agree, they must abide."

This simple yet powerful principle defines the movement. Users, not corporations, set the terms. Any company that wants customers must 
respect consumer rights, digital ownership, and privacy protections.

What the Anti-EULA Protects
âœ… No Forced Arbitration â€“ Users retain full legal rights in any dispute. 
âœ… Digital Purchases Are Yours Forever â€“ No surprise access revocations. 
âœ… Privacy is Non-Negotiable â€“ Geolocation, personal data, and tracking must be opt-in. 
âœ… Full Transparency on Products â€“ No hidden security risks, forced updates, or feature removals post-purchase. 
âœ… Consumer-Centric Agreements â€“ Users can issue their own customized terms companies must follow.

Open-Source & Publicly Available
The Anti-EULA template is free for anyone to use, modify, and enforce. It exists to challenge corporate dominance over digital rights and create a baseline of 
fairness that corporations cannot override.
