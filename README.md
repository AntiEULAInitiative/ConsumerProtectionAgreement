Anti-EULA Initiative
Reclaiming Consumer Rights in Digital Agreements
An open-source framework for fair, transparent, and enforceable consumer protection.

🚀 Mission
EULAs (End User License Agreements) have long been one-sided, favoring corporations while stripping consumers of basic rights. The Anti-EULA Initiative aims to flip the script—empowering users to issue Consumer Protection Agreements that companies must honor.

Our goal is simple: make digital agreements fair. This project provides an open-source framework that individuals, businesses, and legal experts can refine into an alternative contract to protect user data, privacy, refunds, and digital ownership.

🔑 Core Principles
✅ Consumer-Controlled Agreements
Users set the terms—not corporations.

No forced arbitration or hidden fees.

No data exploitation or invasive tracking.

🔐 Privacy & Security First
Geolocation cannot be shared without explicit permission.

Users own their data and digital purchases.

Companies bear full liability for data leaks.

⚖️ Legal Accountability
Users retain the right to legal action without waiver.

Transparency in product updates, risks, and service changes.

No unilateral modifications after acceptance.

📜 License & Usage
